# Calendarify

A gamified calendar application with event management and task tracking. Users can create recurring events and mark tasks complete. Built with React, FullCalendar, and modern web technologies.
## Features

- **Multi-view Calendar**: Month, week, day, and year views with seamless navigation
- **Event Management**: Create, edit, and delete events with color coding and recurring patterns
- **Task Completion**: Mark events as complete with confetti celebration
- **Authentication System**: User login/signup with profile management
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between dark and light themes
- **Gamification UI**: Tier system, achievements, and sticker collection (static data)

## How It Works

Users create and manage calendar events with recurring patterns across multiple views (month, week, day, year). Events can be marked complete with visual feedback, and the interface includes a gamification system with tier progression and achievement tracking to encourage consistent usage.
